I"È<p>Yo. Itâ€™s that bird. Mechasparrow. Iâ€™ve been doing some dev and making some tutorials.</p>

<h1 id="what-have-i-been-coding-this-week">What have I been coding this week?</h1>

<p>Well Iâ€™m still kinda building the Scavenger hunt app, but I put that as second priority coding wise. The main application Iâ€™m working is called <strong>repeatic</strong>.</p>

<p>Repeatic is a habit task app with RPG elements.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h1>

<p>It means that as you complete certain tasks or solidify habits, you interact with a sort of game environment in the process. Kinda like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a>. You gain XP or lose health depending on how well you complete tasks and stay committed to habits.</p>

<h1 id="how-am-i-building-it">How am I building it?</h1>

<p>with JavaScript and React.JS</p>

<h1 id="whats-the-progress-so-far">Whats the progress so far?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>complete tasks</li>
  <li>gain xp</li>
  <li>create tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>I plan on incorporating some pixel art aesthetics. Bad newsâ€¦ Itâ€™s going to be a lot of initially bad pixel art :D</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it so far. The repo is over at <a href="https://github.com/Mechasparrow/repeatic">github</a></p>

<h1 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h1>

<p>I completed another tutorial over on LiveEdu. LiveEdu is an online livestreaming programming education platform. I plan on starting to publish YouTube videos <em>at some point</em>.</p>

<p>Backend development has begun on the scavenger hunt application. So I would say maybe another good 70% to go regarding that app.</p>

<p>School starts less then one week from nowâ€¦ Pretty riveting IMO.</p>
