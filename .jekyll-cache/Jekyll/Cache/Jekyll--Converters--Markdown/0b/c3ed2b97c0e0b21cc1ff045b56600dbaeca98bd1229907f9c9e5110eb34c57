I"%<p>Hey everyone. I’ve been focused on school and work related matters recently, so I haven’t had much time to work on the blog. Before I was about to start blogging, I realized I needed to make some changes to the website.</p>

<p>The main feature that I added to the website was a <strong>work</strong> page. I listed links to my Github, LinkedIn, and Product Hunt page. In addition, I also wrote an excerpt for notable projects that I have worked and am currently working on.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>The next features that will be added to the website will be a <strong>category</strong> and <strong>archive</strong> page.</p>

<p>The category page is for organizing my several blog posts and content more effectively.</p>

<p>The archive page is needed because I still have quite a bit of blog posts from Medium that I need to move over.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well that’s it for today’s developments. If you enjoy my work/writing please be sure to share or comment below. You can also contact me directly at mechasparrow@gmail.com</p>
