<h3 id="spoiler-warning">SPOILER WARNING:</h3>

<p>This post contains potential spoilers about the show, if you have not watched Tatami Galaxy, I’d recommend watching the show first before reading this review. You can watch it over at <a href="http://Enter URLhttps://www.funimation.com/shows/the-tatami-galaxy/">Funimation</a>.</p>

<p>I just finished watching Tatami Galaxy. A story about a college student and trying to live it out “rose-colored” college life. Each episode shows an alternate version of his college life that differs by the clubs he joins.</p>

<p>The show has found a place in my list of favorite anime to watch. There are several reasons as to why this is the case.</p>

<h1 id="art-style">Art Style</h1>

<p>The art style is a lot rougher and a wide color pallet throughout the show. There are also some episodes that also use experimental illustrations as well.</p>

<p>One example is in one episode where the backdrops are pictures of real places, while the characters are still animated in the real setting.</p>

<h1 id="cast-of-characters">Cast of Characters</h1>

<p>The great part of having the show be based on parallel universes is that we get to see a large range of how characters behave in a multitude of situations. If you only watched one episode of Tatami Galaxy, you would only have one impression to go off of for a character instead of the “full story”.</p>

<p>My favorite character would have to Ozu since he pulls the narrator into many questionable activities.</p>

<h1 id="decent-plot">Decent Plot</h1>

<p>At first, the plot may seem very convoluted. However, once you get through the first couple of episodes, it begins to tie in quite nicely. The last few episodes of the show are able to tie in all the subplots in a very satisfying manner through the concept of “infinite” 4.5 tatami rooms.</p>

<p>You’ll just have to wait until you get to that episode to see exactly what I mean.</p>

<h1 id="the-negatives">The Negatives</h1>

<p>Here are some of the negatives of the show.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very fast narration</li>
  <li>Can be repetitive at times</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Overall, I think the pros of this show outweigh the cons. I would just say that one should be patient for the first couple of episodes as it establishes some of the core characters and motifs of the story.</p>

<p>I would give this show a 4/5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
