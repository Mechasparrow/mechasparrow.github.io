I"0<p>We all have commitments. Commitments that are mandatory and commitments that are optional.</p>

<p>We may carry the commitment of school, work, family, etc.
These are types of commitments that could be considered mandatory.</p>

<p>However, there are the optional ones.
After-School clubs, meetups, hanging out with friends, etc</p>

<p>Depending on our value systems, we may place a very high or low priority on these commitments.</p>

<p>But..</p>

<p>If you don’t leave any slack in your life, how can you truly dedicate yourself to the commitments that are necessary to uphold?</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to cut away these extraneous commitments. You can always come back to things when you feel like you can actually balance them.</p>

<p>Commitments can’t be balanced in the first place if you don’t have the time to plan and organize in the first place.</p>

<p>In that case, set aside at least an hour a week to look at all your commitments and plan things around accordingly. A schedule helps.</p>

<p>So that’s that.</p>
