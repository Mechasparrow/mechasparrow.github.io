I"•<p>So high school has been pretty interesting so far. I would like to say that I would like to get out of here and soon as possible. That feeling is greatly enhanced by that fact that I have one year left of high school. So in this article Iâ€™ll just go through the rundown of some key things that happened each year.</p>

<p>Freshmen</p>
<ul>
  <li>Took classes</li>
  <li>Joined clubs</li>
  <li>Coded</li>
</ul>

<p>Sophomore</p>
<ul>
  <li>Took classes</li>
  <li>Kept doing clubs</li>
  <li>Coded</li>
  <li>Virtual Business</li>
</ul>

<p>Junior
Took Â½ classes + Spark</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spark is just more coding</li>
  <li>Quit some clubs joined new clubs</li>
  <li>Experimented a bit and then cut off sketchy friends</li>
</ul>

<p>Senior</p>
<ul>
  <li>IDK</li>
</ul>

<p>Within all of these years of high school and public education so far. I would have to say that my Junior year of high school has been the most valuable to me. The stakes were higher with exams like the ACT. Some classes I took were extremely interesting as well. Especially Government and Crime and Law. With how Iâ€™ve been taking classes, hopefully, senior year will not be that bad :D</p>
