<p>So I started utilizing a system that I havenâ€™t used since Summer Break started and I thought that I should share it. Itâ€™s quite simple (I think)</p>

<h1 id="the-system">The System</h1>

<p>I use this text editor on occasion called Emacs. Within Emacs they have special modes/plugins. One of the modes are called <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org mode</a>. With in Org Mode you can do you can write notes/agendas/todos and so much more</p>

<h1 id="how-is-this-system-used">How is this system used</h1>

<p>Everyday when I wake up in the morning (and have the energy), I create a new agenda file. This agenda file is a simple checklist file that has tasks separated into several categories.</p>

<h1 id="categories">Categories?</h1>
<p>Yeah categories.</p>

<h1 id="like-what">Like What?</h1>

<p>The categories that I have setup right now are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Mental</li>
  <li>Physical</li>
  <li>Spiritual (i.e Buddhism, Philos, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>By dividing all my tasks into these categories I can maintain a productive level of energy without burning myself out.</p>

<h1 id="and-sysexit1">And sys.exit(1);</h1>

<p>Thatâ€™s it for now. Iâ€™ll modify this post with links tomorrowâ€¦</p>
