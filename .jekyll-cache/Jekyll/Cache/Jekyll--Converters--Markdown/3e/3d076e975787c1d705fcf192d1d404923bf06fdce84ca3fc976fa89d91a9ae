<p>Spark was a high school program that I participated in from 2017-2019. It is focused on giving students hands-on experience towards their future careers. In my case, that was software engineering and technology.</p>

<p>In the class, I worked on several projects and competed in many competitions. It was the highlight of my last 2 years of high school.</p>
