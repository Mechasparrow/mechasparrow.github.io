I"j<p>I recently stated that I would be moving off Medium and writing mainly on my personal website.</p>

<p>Main issue with this though is I have quite a bit of stories on Medium.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution?</h2>

<p>So the solution to this is pretty simple actually. Medium allows writers to download a zipped archive of all their posts.</p>

<p>I will just have to create a page on a website that links to all archived posts. They will be viewed as unstyled HTML webpages.</p>

<p>I’m sorry :P</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s it for now on this piece of development. I will update about this once it is completed.</p>
