<p>Especially when most of the time your experience is <strong>lone wolf</strong> coding. So for some reason, I decided to take a leadership position in a team project of 8 people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know how to manage people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how do you manage that many people and try to build a product in eight weeks?</p>

<p><em>Trial and Error</em> my friend.</p>

<h1 id="getting-everyone-on-board">Getting everyone on board</h1>
<p>Alright, you starting from ground zero. How do you start getting to work?</p>

<p>To start you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand each member’s strengths/weaknesses</li>
  <li>Create basic understanding of overall functionality and look of application</li>
  <li>Look at end goal and work backwards</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these help advance the project in some way.</p>

<h2 id="understand-each-members-strengthsweaknesses">Understand each member’s strengths/weaknesses</h2>
<p>Being able to gain a simple understanding of each member allows for better collaboration and team productivity down the road</p>

<h2 id="basic-understanding-of-look-and-feel-of-application">Basic understanding of look and feel of application</h2>
<p>With every team member on the same page (hopefully), the application development will become less difficult as less adjustments will have to be made</p>

<h2 id="look-at-the-end-goal-and-work-backwards">Look at the end goal and work backwards</h2>
<p>Looking at the end goal and working backwards allows for the project to be broken into tasks and user stories. This will aid in the next step which is task delegation.</p>

<h1 id="task-delegation">Task Delegation</h1>
<p>Task delegation is one of the most crucial parts of project management. Without it, everyone would be working on the same features.</p>

<p>A good tool to use for task delegation is a kanban tool like Trello. By using such a system, each member knows exactly what to work on and when it needs to be done.</p>

<h1 id="clearingpreventing-misunderstanding">Clearing/Preventing Misunderstanding</h1>
<p>This is a multifaceted issue, so I will try to offer what has worked for me so far.</p>

<p>In the midst of an misunderstanding, it is best to figure out how the misunderstanding came to be and come to a common consensus with the team member of what needs to be done.</p>

<p>A good way to prevent this from ever happening is to have a workshop that goes over where all the resources, tasks, and information for the project can be found. This saves time and energy as you, the project leader, will not have to answer as many of questions of confusion.</p>
