I"ª<p>Hello. Letâ€™s talk about growth.</p>

<h1 id="water-the-plant">Water the plant</h1>

<p>We all struggle with something, but there is always room for growth. Just a plant needs water and sunlight to grow, energy and time must be spent to improve as an individual in all aspects of life.</p>

<h1 id="growth-as-a-trajectory-for-motivation-and-emotional-upswing">Growth as a trajectory for motivation and emotional upswing</h1>

<p>There may be times where you may be feeling grim or sadâ€¦ Perhaps even hopeless. However, if you can tell yourself that you will resolve the following day to improve at somethingâ€¦ anything. Things inevitable will get better. How many things get better depends.</p>

<h1 id="commit-to-it">Commit to it</h1>

<p>If you challenge yourself to improve something in your life the next day, you need to commit to it. At the very least, you should write it down prior. It also stands to be a commitment that can be looked back to on that day.</p>

<p>If you feel that you could not achieve the level of improvement that you wanted to reach, break it down.</p>

<p>Break it down further into something within your capacity and build from there.</p>

<p>Not many people can run a marathon without any prior training. Do not think you are the exception.</p>

<p>Start from the general case and work from there.</p>

<hr />

<p>Best of luck to your growth, however small or large it may be.</p>
