I".<p>There is something.</p>

<p>Something that we are running from.<br />
or<br />
Something that we are running towards.</p>

<p>We tend to run from things that are uncomfortable to think about and run towards things that are comforting.</p>

<p>We may even stop trying to run. This is still running. Running away by not doing. Running away from our potential</p>

<p>Some of us. We may decide to run towards the uncomfortable, the unknown.</p>

<p>It may be scary at times.</p>

<p>But wouldnâ€™t you rather run towards something then run away from it?</p>
