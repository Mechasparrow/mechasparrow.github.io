<p><a href="/archive">/archive</a></p>

<p>I went over to medium. There I downloaded an archive of all my posts I wrote. They were saved as pure HTML files.</p>

<p>I put them all into a folder labeled “archive”</p>

<p><strong>bad news</strong>: They are still pure HTML files :(</p>

<p>Please be sure to check out the archived posts at</p>

<p><a href="/archive">/archive</a> or on my <a href="https://medium.com/@mechasparrow">Medium</a> page</p>
