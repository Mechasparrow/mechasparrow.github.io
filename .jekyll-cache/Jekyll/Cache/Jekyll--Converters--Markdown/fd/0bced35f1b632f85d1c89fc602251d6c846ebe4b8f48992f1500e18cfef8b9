I"3<p>Well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Kindness is the result of understanding that we all live in the same world and breath the same air.</p>

<p>Hatred is the result of a misunderstanding how things actually are and drawing artificial lines between people and others.</p>

<p>It is very easy to be hateful and very hard to be kind.</p>

<p>However, kindness does not mean being nice. It does not mean following the script written by society.</p>

<p>Kindness means that you are honest and understanding as much as you can be in any moment.</p>
