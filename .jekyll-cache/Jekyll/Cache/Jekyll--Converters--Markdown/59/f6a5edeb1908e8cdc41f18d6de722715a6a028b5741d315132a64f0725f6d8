<p>So with the wonderful amount of time I have allocated during the summer. I get to do some things that I would not normally do on a school day.</p>

<p>Noteâ€¦ Itâ€™s like one in the morning soâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="hmmm">HMMM</h2>

<p>Hmm indeed. I have been coding something to do with Anime and some other cutesy things. Though anime is a niche, I plan on expanding it onto other stuff. Then I can just integrate with like 5 apis for ex (YouTube, Netflix, SoundCloud, etcâ€¦â€¦.)</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-code-today">What did I code today?</h2>
<p>Looky here -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/Mechasparrow/Animuku" title="Animuku">Github Link</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™ll have a prototype out later this week. (I think)</p>

<h2 id="what-will-happen-tomorrow">What will happen tomorrow</h2>

<p>Probably more coding.
Iâ€™ll also start working on my more <em>serious</em> app. More detail on that tomorrow</p>

<p>See ya next time.</p>
