I" <p>There is so much to be fear to be had in the world. There is no guarantee of what will happen in the future. The only thing that is constant is the impermanent present. From one moment to the next, something changes. Even if it is not noticeable at first.</p>

<p>This directly leads to fear. Fear stems from uncertainty and irreversible negatives. Ex.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What if I fail that exam? I’ll be ruined</em><br />
<em>If I fall, I’ll die</em><br />
<em>I’m probably going to fail the exam anyway. Should I even study?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, some of these fears may not be realistic. Other times, these fears are well grounded. Having a fear of falling can probably prevent you from a premature death depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Other times, this fear can be paralyzing and detrimental. Like the fear of a certain event occurring. The more we fear this event occurring, we paradoxically increase the potential of the event occurring.</p>

<p>The best antidote to fear is reason. By using reason through methods of self-conditioning and analysis, we can eventually come to the conclusion as to whether or fear is baseless or not. That it is not the end of the world if we properly handle the circumstances and how we process it.</p>

<p>When I mean by self-conditioning is by voluntarily exposing yourself to ever increasing versions of you fear. By doing so, you can slowly chip away any logical fallacies that your fear is built upon.</p>

<p>A bit more of a philosophical post.</p>
