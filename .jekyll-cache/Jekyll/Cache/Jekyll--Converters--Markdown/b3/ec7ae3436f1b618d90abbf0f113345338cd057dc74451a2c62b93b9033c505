<p>Hey. This is Michael. After several restless weeks of not blogging, I’ve decided to quit Medium. Instead, I will be blogging on my website <a href="https://mechasparrow.github.io">mechasparrow</a></p>

<p>I feel that by blogging on my own website, I will have greater control of what I write about and the content I produce.</p>

<h2 id="devlogs">DevLogs</h2>

<p>I will continue writing DevLogs. Expect those to be published weekly on Thursdays. New projects include an RSS Feed Reader, Cryptocurrent/blockchain, and a game! I can’t wait to talk about it these projects.</p>

<h2 id="poems-and-creative-endeavors">Poems and Creative endeavors</h2>

<p>A couple months back, I experimented with alternative genres of writing. These mainly included poems and philosophical pieces. I will continue writing these type of posts as well.</p>

<h2 id="livestreaming-and-youtube-videos">Livestreaming and YouTube videos</h2>

<p>I plan on creating course material and other types of content on platforms such as Youtube, Twitch.tv and LiveCoding.edu . I will post written post versions of these videos and courses.</p>
