<p>Alright Iâ€™m tired. Itâ€™s 10:30. Whatever.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll talk about the progress of the game Iâ€™ve been building for the past couple of weeks</p>

<p>Here we go</p>

<h2 id="story">Story</h2>

<p>The game, Rodnova, is a game where you are Rod. Rod is a young scarf wearing Novian who was made fun of because he wore a scarf. The games main purpose is show that regardless of who people tell you, heros can come from unlikely sources and should not be underestimated. Rod goes on a journey to prove his strength and save his village from the 4 demons of the apocalypse. Thatâ€™s the story I have in my head so far.</p>

<h2 id="level-design">Level Design</h2>
<p>The levels are split into 6 sections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tutorial</li>
  <li>Grasslands</li>
  <li>Firelands</li>
  <li>Waterlands</li>
  <li>Airlands</li>
  <li>Village</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these sections have 4 levels except the Village stage, and the Tutorial levels.</p>

<p>Each set of levels is intended to present Rod with new challenged and new game mechanics.</p>

<p>I have not designed many games before hand so the level design still needs much work</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>I finished up most of the Airlands levels. I just have to creat the boss level for Airlands and that is it for that section.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I will complete the Airlands boss, and begin working on the Village levels</p>

<h2 id="other-updates">Other updates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Turned 17</li>
  <li>Building web application in Spark</li>
  <li>Eating, Sleeping, High School, Coding</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Game will come out within the following weeks</em><br />
Stay tuned!</p>

<p>â€“ Mecha</p>
