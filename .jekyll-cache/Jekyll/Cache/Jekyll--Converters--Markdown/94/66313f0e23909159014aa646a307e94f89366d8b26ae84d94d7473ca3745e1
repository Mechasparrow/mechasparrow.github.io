I"|<p>Hello.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I’m currently working on this new project called <strong>Alkonost</strong>. It’s basically an web app that gives you news from a variety of sources.</p>

<p>I’m building it right now to help diversify my own news reading. <strong>Version 1.0</strong> will have a set amount of connected new feeds and categories.</p>

<p>The initial categories for the app will be</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tech</li>
  <li>Business</li>
  <li>Sports</li>
  <li>Politics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tech">The tech</h2>

<p>The application is mostly built with the <strong>ionic framework</strong>. It is a useful tool for building mobile web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I highly recommend if you are trying to build hybrid applications.</p>

<p>I also have to write a <strong>RSS parser</strong> in the app. I found a library that does most of the hard work for me. However, there is still some kinks I need to work out.</p>

<p>Most of the tech for this project was built out 2 months back for a tutorial I created. I am repurposing that code and publishing it.</p>

<p>The main issue right now is the exerpts creation. A user should not be able to view the entire article within the app. Instead, they should only be able to view an shortened version.</p>

<hr />

<p>I will write more regarding this project as it progresses. That’s all I have for now.</p>
