<p>I just finished up the first demo version of Planeta. It is a space puzzle game where you are trying to get back to his home planet.</p>

<h1 id="how-the-game-came-about">How the game came about</h1>

<p>I was assigned a project in my technology class to design a video game. I was also taking AP Physics 1 at the same time, so I decided to try to make a game that had to do with physics and space.</p>

<p>Initially, I tried to model the game off of real world gravitation physics. Two weeks before the game demo, I pivoted that game mechanic towards having fixed gravitational fields.</p>

<p>I also used to play Mario Galaxy when I was very young, so I decided I should make something that had to do with jumping from planet to planet.</p>

<p>Well, I plan on updating and improving the game over the next month or so, and plan out a 1.0 launch.</p>

<p>Feedback is also greatly appreciated as it will help improve the game.</p>
