<p>Things can be taken in two layers of depth, the surface level and the deep level.</p>

<h1 id="at-surface-level">At Surface Level</h1>

<p>At the surface level, things may seem uninteresting. Just off minimal observation, we may find things uninteresting if it does not directly concern us.</p>

<h1 id="at-the-deep-level">At the deep level</h1>

<p>At the deeper level, anything and everything is interesting. Even the simplest things like the observation of a falling apple (Newton) carries the most indefinite of complexities.</p>

<p>Look deeper and find these complexities, and you wonâ€™t be disappointed.</p>
