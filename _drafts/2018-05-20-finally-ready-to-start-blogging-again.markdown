## So many ideas... To much over optimization
MEHH
Hey everyone. Mechasparrow a.k.a Michael here. Another year of school is coming to a close. And I am finally able to begin reallocating time to the work I'm passionate about.

## What have I been doing?
So I've kinda been in the dark for a couple of months with very few (or none) blog posts during that time. I've been doing these things mainly...

- Game Development
- Studying for Finals
- Building a new Website

## What's going these next months
I'm going to be studying computer science, graphic design, and other just enriching things. I will also be attempting to live stream often. I'm not to sure about YouTube yet.

Also blogging... Blogging will make a consistent return.
