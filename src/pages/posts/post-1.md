# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. Installed Nitro
2. Reinstalled Astro

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
