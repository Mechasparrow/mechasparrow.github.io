There were about 15 teams competing. Each team was composed of individuals of varying skill levels.</p><p name="72e3" id="72e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some were beginners who were just starting out while others were professions who did software development for a living.</p><p name="c5cf" id="c5cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main objective of the hackathon was to help make St. Louis a more pet friendly city. This was a very broad goal that lent itself to a multitude of potential solutions.</p><p name="da87" id="da87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The competition was a total span of three days with the third one dedicated to presentation.</p></div></div></section><section name="0435" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="9d09" id="9d09" class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading">Day One</h4><p name="e063" id="e063" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">For us, most of our ideation and preparation occurred on the first day. We created a large doc of potential ideas. About 1–2 hours in we had the list narrowed down to 3–4 potential ideas.</p><p name="5104" id="5104" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the first day, they were offering a panel of pet care experts. By listening to this panel, we were able to narrow down our choices to just two.</p><p name="8799" id="8799" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After further research, we narrowed it down to just one idea and named it… <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Doggos (and Cattos) for World Peace</strong>.</p><p name="3357" id="3357" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The goal of our project was to match pet owners with non-pet owners to keep the pet company while the owner was away.</p><p name="7260" id="7260" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of the first day, we were able to delineate most tasks and were prepared for the next day of work.</p><h4 name="ff21" id="ff21" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Day Two</h4><p name="a3b4" id="a3b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The second day was by far the hardest. I was on <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">front-end</strong> and another team member was on <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">backend</strong>. We had a task list that looked near impossible to complete at the beginning.</p><p name="40da" id="40da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From about 8:00 am in the morning to 1:00 am the next morning, I was either coding or testing the project. It was about around half-way through coding the project when it really seemed that it was coming together.</p><p name="1f00" id="1f00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given that I had one of the largest chunks of work, I was last one to complete their section of the project.</p><h4 name="290f" id="290f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Day Three</h4><p name="11e5" id="11e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The final day was the most exciting. In the morning, me and the rest of team finished tying the loose ends of the project (color palettes, extra features, etc) and prepared our presentation booth.</p><p name="a949" id="a949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first round of judging was like a science fair expo. The judges walked from booth to booth and watched demos and explanations of projects. After we presented our project, we were able to take a look at the projects that other teams produced.</p><p name="03bb" id="03bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of the first round of judging, we were called into finals along with 5 other teams.</p><p name="194b" id="194b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In finals, we gave a more in depth presentation of our project and its purpose. At the end, we won <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3rd place</strong>.</p><h3 name="c9b0" id="c9b0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Why did I go?</strong></h3><p name="f2b9" id="f2b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A year before this event, I attended a hackathon called GlobalHack VI. My team made it to semifinals. We felt very close to winning, yet we did not make it into the past round.</p><p name="11a8" id="11a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ever since that competition, I’ve been looking for another hackathon to test my skills and aim for the top. I also became a member of the pet community two months prior, so I felt I could produce a useful project.</p><p name="7bf3" id="7bf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I enjoy the atmosphere of hackathons and the chaos involved. The solutions that come out of hackathons can also be very creative and interesting to see.</p><p name="df65" id="df65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mainly wanted to grow my skills when it came to web app development, teamwork, and project presentations.</p><h3 name="f944" id="f944" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">How was it useful?</strong></h3><p name="cd2a" id="cd2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The competition was useful in many ways. The most obvious one was that we won 3rd place. This came with a fairly good prize along with it. In the longer term, I believe I have developed new skills in time management, project management, and presentation/speaking.</p><p name="5c30" id="5c30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Project management skills were developed during the first two days as tasks were delegated and tracked.</p><p name="bd8e" id="bd8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Time management was most crucial on the second day since a large sum of work completed in a short period of time. This required balancing priorities and handling obstacles.</p><p name="3e52" id="3e52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Presentation and Speaking skills were developed during the third day of the hackathon. During the public expo of the projects, I was required to demo my application to several people and become articulate in my presentation of the project.</p><p name="f307" id="f307" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I look forward to attending more competitions in the future (Hopefully with the same team).</p></div></div></section><section name="3f12" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="97ff" id="97ff" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><a href="https://medium.com/u/e053a37a8888" data-href="https://medium.com/u/e053a37a8888" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="e053a37a8888" data-action-value="e053a37a8888" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Michael Navazhylau</a> is a Software Engineer in St.Louis who loves building cool and useful software.
