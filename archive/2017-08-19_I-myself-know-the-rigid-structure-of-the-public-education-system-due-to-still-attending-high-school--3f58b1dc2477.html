I also do understand the inability for this to happen. They would not want to give students the ability to question the system that they are currently in. The people running the system don’t want it to change that often.</p><p name="f3a3" id="f3a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I do feel that as ideology has replaced philosophy.

Which is a soft skill that is highly valued I believe.</p><p name="893a" id="893a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">There are many boundaries to push through that would be almost impossible to attain the public education realm. However, it is good to theorize how education good be done better and have it applied even outside of school.</p></div></div></section>
