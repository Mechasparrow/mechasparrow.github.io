It tells the story of the creation of Facebook which has become one of the most powerful tech companies in the world. I finally got the time to watch the movie from beginning to end (Only watched excerpts from time to time before). I’ll discuss some interesting underlying messages that appear throughout the movie in this article.</p></div></div></section><section name="9aba" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a434" id="a434" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">If you can think it, build it</h3><p name="3568" id="3568" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">With the increasing amount of JavaScript libraries and tools out there for building software. One can get caught up in trying to make the perfect stack. We see Mark just start coding the moment he has the idea. It shows how friction-less the creation of somethings can be. However, we should also take into account that he was drunk while he was blogging and hacking personal information of women that attended Harvard. He also got dumped from his girlfriend as well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p><h3 name="eddc" id="eddc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Take advantage of the network</h3><p name="c304" id="c304" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This message is probably the most obvious since the movie is called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Social Network</em>, but this goes another step further in describing product launches. Sometimes people will try to launch a product by submitting it to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" data-href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>. In the film, Eduardo builds up the first emailing list by slowly going through a college fraternity selection process. Mark knowing that he couldn’t just send it to his friends because the network would be too small, takes advantage of Eduardo’s email list. He uses it to spread the social network across the campus through the leaders of the most popular frat house in Harvard.</p><h3 name="e908" id="e908" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">(Bonus) Peoples problems can sometimes lead to Ideas you never thought of</h3><p name="0d3a" id="0d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">The relationship status scene from the movie was probably one of my most favorite scenes from it. One of Mark’s colleagues talks about a girl with him and her possible relationship status. This leads Mark into having an epiphany to put relationship statuses on Facebook as the final feature for the first version. This comes to show that some ideas can happen by talking to people experienced (or inexperienced) in a field and what problems they are facing whether explicitly or implicitly.</p></div></div></section><section name="5c7a" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="19a7" id="19a7" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Those were some underlying messages that I saw from watching <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Social Network</em>. I know that this movie could be considered outdated, but I still think that the movie has still found ways to be relevant.
