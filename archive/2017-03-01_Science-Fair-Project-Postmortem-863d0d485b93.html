One requirement as a result is that a science fair project has to be done. The main catch was that it had to be related to Biology in some way or form. I decided that it would be a cool project to research yeast and how it is effected by certain sugars. That’s how the project was born.</p><h3 name="0ced" id="0ced" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Research Counts!</h3><p name="a3ed" id="a3ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When you are conducted a science project in particular. Research is an important step in the process. Without it, it is next to impossible to complete a research paper or conduct a useful experiment. You want to build upon what others before your experiment have done. I learned this quite far into the project while I was writing the research paper. There were definitely gaps in the research that we conducted.</p><h3 name="bcca" id="bcca" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Don’t Procrastinate</h3><p name="8ad7" id="8ad7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I know that it’s sad quite a bit, but seriously when it comes to a project like this. The less time you cut yourself, the harder it will to conduct a good experiment and write the research paper. Due to waiting late into the first semester. We were only able to collect 48 hours of our experiment. Because this was a project that relied mostly on time, more time would have worked in our favor.</p><h3 name="9475" id="9475" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Don’t expect it to be easy…</h3><p name="4fd1" id="4fd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">This is a fairly subjective thing for me to say, but when it comes to science fair projects they just get hard the older you get. The first two science fair experiments I conducted were super simple, yet I was able to achieve a high score for them. In high school, that does not really cut it. They mostly want you to do something that actually requires work. For us, we had to work from the ground up because we had no idea how yeast fermentation of ethanol works.</p></div></div></section><section name="c607" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="b186" id="b186" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Please heart, follow, or share this article if you found it interesting.
