I started thinking about perspective a little. This is probably due to the sheer amount of homework I have. Usually when it comes to school homework + school, it just morphs together. So that being said I really enjoy working on any thing that’s not school relates. Whether that would be art, writing, or programming. I was offered to build a website today. I had to decline the offer though because of the scope of the project. Me being a high school student does not allow for much free time. The scope of the project was something that would be year long. Since there so many other things I could do with that time, I made the logical decision. The good news is that I am still getting experience from my Virtual Enterprise class that everything evens out.</p></div></div></section><section name="50a5" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3fe5" id="3fe5" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">What I get to do in Virtual Enterprise right now</h3><p name="ad7c" id="ad7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In my class, I use square space for building the website. Normally I would use just raw website coding to complete the task. Though I have begun to think that I have become a little biased in the ways I build websites and that I should explore other methods as well. Another thing is square space has support for templates and provides their own templates as well. I don’t usually use templates, so it’s another way of me getting out of my comfort zone. The thing with the field of technology is that it’s very important to be accepting of change in the field. If you hold onto the old way of doing things a little too hard, you may be left behind in the dust.</p><h3 name="3bdc" id="3bdc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">My new side project idea from yesterday</h3><p name="04a8" id="04a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So yesterday after staying up all night with my co-founder, I had the idea of building a smart assistant for myself. Like Jarvis basically. If you don’t know who Jarvis or J.A.R.V.I.S is, he is basically Iron Man’s smart robot assistant. I want to give it a try and build one. I don’t really know how well that will go, but it’s something to pass the time. I think I might try implementing it with natural language processing. Which is one the coolest things I’ve seen. I am trying to avoid machine learning right now. Its a rabbit hole I don’t really want to dive into right now necessarily. I could also come up with a way to verbally program new commands for the AI to use.</p><p name="c351" id="c351" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You might be asking why I might need a smart assistant. Well 2 reasons. One is that some of things I do are very trivial that it can easily be automated. An example of this being opening up all my news. The second reason is its really cool and open ended. I could always add new functionality to it dynamically if need be.</p><p name="f719" id="f719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Adding onto the topic of putting things into perspective and scope, the smart assistant would probably take a little less than a month to build a crude version. In my opinion, this is worth more of my time then building a website that I know I can’t deliver without a knowable end to it.</p></div></div></section><section name="cde7" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a305" id="a305" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Well it’s getting kind of late. So I will hopefully start describing my progress of the smart assistant starting tomorrow as a section of this blog. Till next time.</p></div></div></section>
