Globalhack 6 was probably one of the biggest hackathons in the midwest. I’d like to describe each day in detail a bit.</p></div></div></section><section name="a48d" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="ba2d" id="ba2d" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Day 1 — registration, idea creation, and prep</h3><p name="b1da" id="b1da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Me and my main team member registered and then went into the arena. We were stunned by the size of the building. After recovering from the initial shock, we went down and found a table. We met one of the developers of Ionic which was pretty cool. We were also sitting next to one of the past winners of globalhack. Our team was mainly built up of one web designer, two pitchers/designers, and one programmer. That would be me. In the youth division there were 25 teams. We decided to call our team the Morality Machine. I’ll be publishing the open source project later this week. We basically started with the first idea we had. Which means we basically ignored prep. No wire frames, No project management, etc. Some things were not needed since technically I was the only programmer on the team. However I do regret not wire framing and diagramming the project.</p><h3 name="50fb" id="50fb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Day 2 — The programming</h3><p name="f61a" id="f61a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So I woke up, ate a super cookie and oatmeal, drank tea, then went back to the arena. Me and the designer were the first one there out of the team. She showed me an awesome logo, and we decided to use it. My web designer came at around 1:00 pm. This limited what we could pull off by a little. We decided to go with data analyse. This meant I took the data and ran it through some magical algorithm. i.e the morality algorithm. This took the data and gave a priority to the homeless people on record. I built it mostly in NodeJS, Express backend wise then HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At around 9:00 pm we completed the MVP. My web designer did not really implement any of the functionality.</p><h3 name="dcfd" id="dcfd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Day 3 — The pitching</h3><p name="f4a3" id="f4a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">Woke up and went back to the arena. We gave two presentations science fair style. We later made it to semi-finals. Sadly we did not win. I’m am surprised how much we completed with just one programmer. Our pitchers did wonderful pitching even with technically difficulties.</p></div></div></section><section name="ac7e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="821d" id="821d" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">What was learned</h3><p name="72cb" id="72cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">Team synergy is essential. If team synergy is low, it can make even a team of 8 people not as useful as a team of 4. Also software design and UX is just as important as implementation. Well that’s about it.</p></div></div></section>
