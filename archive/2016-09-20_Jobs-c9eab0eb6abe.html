Where I live, the official age to work without a work permit is 16 years of age. There are some jobs that aren’t always shown to the job boards available to students. In this blog post I am going to list some issues that are currently faced by teens looking for jobs.</p></div></div></section><section name="7b8a" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1888" id="1888" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">There are websites currently made for providing teens with part-time jobs. The issue with them is that they are poorly designed leading to confusion. I’m am just saying this upfront.</p><p name="1c64" id="1c64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first issue I’d like to discuss is the pay rate. It would not be a stretch to help teenagers find the right job by providing them information on the pay rate. This can easily done with a simple platform. It would need to be subject to moderation though.</p><p name="4ced" id="4ced" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second issue is work environment. Some part-time jobs are under poor management. This can lead to late checks, and unnecessary workload. This could be solved by creating a anonymous review system for workplaces.</p><p name="1248" id="1248" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The last thing I’d like to discuss is what I discussed at the beginning about online job boards. There a currently little or no good online job boards. This would be beneficially to many teenagers looking for a good job beyond the job board that is provided by the school or the local cafe.</p><p name="8a34" id="8a34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Well that’s it for now. I may revisit this issue sometime later in the future.</p></div></div></section>
