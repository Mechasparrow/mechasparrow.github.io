I managed to avoid the several tests that I discussed of in yesterday’s blog post. However I would have to say the interesting parts of the school day was Virtual Enterprise class. As I have discussed in previous blog posts. Virtual Enterprise as a class where students participate in a virtual firm. Along with being assigned the role of web designer, I was also given the responsibility of department head of tech.</p><h3 name="7870" id="7870" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Benefits of being head of tech</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="765c" id="765c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">get to boss upperclassmen around</li><li name="abb2" id="abb2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Be an important voice in department meetings</li><li name="5366" id="5366" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Interact with other departments and manage tasks</li></ul><p name="9d0d" id="9d0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I heavily enjoy this. The great part was one of the first investors of St. Louis Bread co came to give a talk to the class. This led to getting some interesting insight about business.</p><h3 name="0d78" id="0d78" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">what was learned from the talk</h3><p name="5bea" id="5bea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">One of the key points that I took away from talk was that switching gears is not that hard if you have the correct base skills. This is especially true for someone who is taking a business major. That would be because the skills you learn in business school can be applied to almost any business model. Such example would be marketing, real estate, accounting, etc.</p><p name="bf24" id="bf24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another point that was brought up was that of knowing the company to join. If you are to join a company that isn’t really growing anymore or is stable and has a stable stream of customers, the amount of growth in your career will not be as much. However if you join a small growing business, you will encounter more growth opportunities.</p><p name="87b2" id="87b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My third and final point that I took away is that first risk you take in business you take is always the hardest. After that the risks don’t seem as bad in the long run.</p></div></div></section><section name="4577" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="9565" id="9565" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Well that’s it for blog post.
