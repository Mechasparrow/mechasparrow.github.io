I take upon interesting projects. Sometimes in these projects I encounter tough problems to solve. They often feel so hard that I don’t know if I will ever reach the solution. I eventually do which is just how it works. When It comes to problems or bugs that you are having a tough time solving, it’s always a good idea to take the problem solving away from the computer.</p></div></div></section><section name="fec1" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="618e" id="618e" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Ways I solve (computer) problems</h3><p name="f43c" id="f43c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Usually whenever I encounter a problem, I see if I can find the root cause or if there are multiple smaller problems. Usually any big problem can be split up into more smaller problems. Finding the root cause of the problem is mostly useful in debugging. This can be done by using strategically placed logging statements. Besides that there are several other things I do that help me solve a problem. This includes</p><ul class="postList"><li name="8efd" id="8efd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">rubber ducking</li><li name="6180" id="6180" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">sleeping on it</li><li name="f2cc" id="f2cc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">meditation</li><li name="ca01" id="ca01" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">white boarding it out</li></ul><p name="badd" id="badd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Out of all of these, my favorite would probably be rubber ducking. This is where an engineer talks about the problem to a inanimate object such as a rubber duck or a person. In doing so the engineer is able to come to a solution that he previously did not think of before.</p><p name="03bb" id="03bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sleeping on it and meditation are both similar methods. When you do one of the two activities, you are able to come back to the problem with a fresh mind. This leads you attempt to solve the problem in a way that you wouldn’t have thought of previously.</p><p name="9436" id="9436" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">White boarding it out does not always work. It sometimes works with people who are more visual thinkers. When they draw/diagram it out, sometimes they are able to see the solution more clearly then just starting at the code.</p></div></div></section><section name="192c" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="bd5f" id="bd5f" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Well I hope that this blog post gave you some insight on how I solve problems that I encounter with software. Tomorrow I will be visiting the pitch conference, so I will make sure to write a review on that. See you next time.</p></div></div></section>
