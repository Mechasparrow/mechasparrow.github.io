Hello everyone. It's that cybernetic birdo again. Mechasparrow.

During the end of college, I‌ started looking at other projects I‌ could work on. The one that stuck out to me the most was redesigning my portfolio website.

I‌ was beginning to feel motivated enough to start creating things again. Something that I‌ haven't had the strong urge to do since college has started.

There was only one catch, I‌ wanted to have a centralized place online where I‌ could publish and link to all my other creations.

And that's where the portfolio website comes in.

## ‌What was wrong with the old website?

Before I started redesigning the website, I‌ needed to know what I‌ was trying to change about the old website required a complete redesign or not?

It needed a complete redesign. Why is that?

The core reason is that the website as a whole did not reflect who I was a developer and a creative. It wasn't that colorful, goofy, and all-around Mechasparrow-esque. (Mechsparrow is might creative persona)

A key contributing cause to this was that I‌ used a pre-made blogging website template. When I‌ wasn't as comfortable in web design or using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this would be a valid starting point for my portfolio website.

However, my experience with web development has improved to the point where building my own portfolio from the ground up was a reasonable project.

As an individual who is past beginner level in web development, a personal website serves as a good project to showcase their skills and abilities.

## The Redesign Process

The redesign process follows several stages. It goes as such...

1. Visual Mockup/Wireframing
2. Planning Out Coding Sessions
3. Developing out website design with placeholders for content
4. Migrating old website posts and projects to the new site
5. Publishing the new website

The last two are worth going into a bit more detail.

### Migrating the content from the old version

Since I‌ was using Jekyll for the static-page generation of blog posts and project pages, I‌ had to migrate that content to the new site. Luckily, my old website was also built with Jekyll, so it was as simple as moving the Markdown files from the old site to the new site project folder.

### Publishing the new website

To publish the new website, I‌ used Github Pages. Github Pages is a free static-site hosting service that Github provides to developers who want to host their developer websites or project websites for their open-source projects.

Luckily, I‌ used Github quite a lot for hosting and backing up my code.

For publishing a website with Github Pages, I‌ just had to go into my GitHub project page settings and tell it to host the project with Github pages and it figured out the rest from there.

## Tools that were used

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/):‌ For generating web-pages and templating
* [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/):‌ For mocking up the new design
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/):‌ For responsive and mobile-friendly compatible and a grid system
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/):‌ For website hosting

## Conclusion

Overall, I think the website redesign went very well. I'll probably apply small design changes here and there as I‌ get more feedback for the website.

It was really cool coding up a website from complete scratch today. I‌ really found it fun and it helped me recultivate the desire to create without completely being overwhelmed.

10/10 would spend several days redesigning my website again.
