# Visiting the St. Louis Zoo

A couple of days back, I‌ visited the St. Louis Zoo with my family. It hasn't really changed all that much for the past couple of months.

Here are some of the highlights of the visit.

## ‌Penguins

I'm an avid fan of penguins. They are one of my favorite birds who can't fly, but they make up for it with their excellent sleeping abilities.

I find them very cute and goofy and love the way they waddle around and navigate their habitat making short hops here and there.

There was an outdoor exhibit and an indoor one that had all sorts of penguins ranging from the traditional ones to puffin birds as well.

## ‌Polar Bear

The exit from the penguin exhibit directly leads to the polar bear exhibit. There we saw the massive polar bear swimming in his pool.

We even got to witness him play with his toy which was a couple of empty barrels connect together. He was fairly skilled at thrashing them about. It was pretty entertaining. It would make a very satisfying sound whenever he would hit it against one of the trees in his habitat.

## Cattos

After which, we walked all the way to the Big Cats area of the zoo.

There were several exhibits for lions, tigers, cheetahs, and other big cats. Given that it was still the morning, most of the large cats were sleeping.

Surrounding the exhibits, there was an information plaque that said that some large cats slept up to 20 hours a day!

My favorite exhibit out of the big cats area was definitely the cheetah. When you would peer down the exhibit, you would see a dirt path that the cheetah has carved out by walking the same path every single day.

It is pretty fascinating to witness all the little things animals do. Some of which serve to be a reminder that we are more similar to other animals than we would like to admit from time to time.

This is both in good ways and bad ways alike.

## ‌Birdos

My favorite area secondary to the penguin exhibit is the bird garden of course!

There they had a combination of birds that they held in large cages both inside and outside a bird building.

Each bird had a different and unique bird call and color design and bodily structure.

The most familiar of the bunch were the owls and the toucans.

Sometimes, I‌'d like to think that every animal has a personality of its own. With each animal, you can break it up into sub-personalities.

This is especially evident with cats and dogs. No two cats or dogs act exactly the same.

I find this perception good for creating/writing stories where animals play an important role.

## Conclusion

It was a great time visiting the zoo with my family. I look forward to checking it out again the next winter break I‌ have from college.

Zoos both serve as a reminder about how extraordinary and diverse nature is. I‌ can't wait to take more exciting adventures like the trip to the Zoo in the future!
