I woke up to the ringing of my alarm clock. I only got five hours of sleep from the coding binge of last night. Staring at the ceiling, I think, “I wonder… What is going to happen today?”. I finally get up from the bed and attend to my hygiene. I dress professionally and I head off to the competition venue.

The last few days have been chaotic. My friends and I from my tech class decided to participate in a programming competition. We’ve been working on a project for the competition since it first started 2 days back. Since then, we have gotten limited sleep. Today is the final day. I arrive at the competition space.

When I arrived, I see the rest of my teammates. Their names are Matt, Haran, and Kit. I showed them all of the work I completed last night despite my sleep deprivation.
Haran turns to me and says, “Great job. You still need to change some things before we can submit it.” I look at the clock on my phone. It said 8:00 am. The deadline was 10:00 am. Two hours. Two hours was all I had to make this app presentable.

I looked back at Haran and said, “We don’t have much time. I can’t really guarantee anything, but I’ll do my best”.

Haran
smiles and says, “Nice! We're counting on you”.

I popped open my laptop and put on my headphones. I  plugged in my mechanical keyboard. I then got to work. My keyboard clacked away as I worked anxiously to complete the app. When I finally looked back at the clock, the time was 9:58 am! It felt as if I just came out of a time capsule. I could barely recall any of the code I wrote in those 2 hours. We made the submission at 10:00 am on the dot. Luckily, it went through.

I looked back to my teammates and said, “The app is finished!”. Everyone became excited and smiled back.

Haran was our presenter. He is a senior in high school and part of the speech and debate team. Even though I coded the project for 12-14 hours straight, I could not even come close to how well Haran could present it.

I took my laptop and went with others to set up the presentation booth. When the judges came to our booth, they look impressed by the app and the aesthetics. That’s mainly because the team and I decided to use cartoon animals in place of actual pictures of pets.

While the judges were deliberating for the first round of judging, I took a look at the other apps and websites that the other teams created. When I saw them, I thought to myself, “These apps are much more impressive than ours. There is no way we would win”. I was completely wrong.
The judges came back. They announced that we and 5 other teams were heading to finals! When I heard that, I was filled with joy. I told my teammates that I couldn’t believe we made it this far. We texted our tech teacher to let him know as well.

Eventually, it was our turn to present on the big stage. Haran began, “Hello. We are Doggos and Cattos for World Peace”. The crowd and judges laughed as we showed them our app. This was actually our intention as we were probably the least serious team there. After we got off the stage, we were eventually greeted by one of the judges. He shook my hand and told us how he wished that he did the things we were doing when he was our age. After that happened, I knew we made it.

When the judging was completed, we were called up and awarded 3rd place with a prize of $1,500 dollars.

Only one thought crossed my mind, “This has to be one of the happiest moments in my life”.

The journey I embarked with my friends came to close, but that was not the end of our journeys together. I learned how to work effectively with others, gained a valuable team I could rely on, and got over a very tough transition in my life. For that, I continue coding.
