# First Semester of College

Hey. I'm Michael. Also known as Mechasparrow

I‌ used to write. Then I stopped. Now, I'm writing again.

I was going to plan out my first blog post and all that fun stuff. I kept saying to myself *I start writing again now.... or right after this... okay now I‌ will.*

And that's how I‌ avoided writing my blog posts for the whole entire semester. Do I‌ regret that? No

No. Because I‌ still wrote. I‌ wrote everyday. Instead, I‌ wrote for myself. Some would even call it a dairy or journal I‌ suppose :)

So this will just be me writing. No editing. Nada. I'm going to write this and hit publish.

## Getting Acclimated to College

Going from a sub-urban high school to the largest public college in Missouri (Mizzou) definitely has a transitional period. Luckily, we didn't have classes for the first week.

With it came, new responsibilities, more time, dating, and new friends.

What I‌ didn't originally anticipate was the balancing of priorities, classes, and time allocated towards oneself.

The main thing that helped me stay on-task and on top of things was using a combination of a todo list and a calendar. I would check these every morning and evening to ensure that I‌ didn't forget anything.

Different approaches are also viable, but this is what worked for me.

During the first couple of weeks, I‌ also personally went out of my way to go to club meetings and social events. This way, I‌ was able to meet people outside of the dorms and my classes.

## College Classes.

My initial experience with college classes with positive overall.

Two of my classes (Computer Science 1050, and Calculus III)‌ were required classes for my major.

The other two (English 1000, and Classic Mythology)‌ were not necessarily related to my major but were taken to pad out the schedule. English 1000 is also just a regular Gen-Ed that many majors have to take at Mizzou.

I‌ originally ended up spending two hours each day taking detailed textbook notes on classic mythology myths, but as the semester went on, I‌ came to the realization I‌ didn't have to take notes to do well.

That significantly lightened my workload for the rest of the semester.

Though this may seem counter intuitive, I‌ believe I‌ got equal value from all the classes I‌ took this semester. I‌ wouldn't have taken different ones if I‌ had the chance.

Next semester, I‌'ll be taking Physics II, Computer Science 2050, Introduction to Logic Systems, Discrete Mathematics, and Public Speaking.

Though it is a bit of a heavier workload than this semester, I'm really excited for the challenge. I'm also glad that it is more math heavy. This means that I‌ can stay in a sort of problem-solving flow state for longer throughout the day only to have to shift into a different gear for public speaking which should be fun too.

## Clubs and Student Organizations

### Web Development

Within the first couple of weeks of college, I‌ happened to become the leader of the Web Development Special Interest Group for the Mizzou Computing Association. Technically a SIG is not considered an student organization, but it is similar.

So from the beginning of the semester till the end, I‌ hosted web development talks with my other comp sci friend (Sophomore). We had a couple people show up for the most part. It isn't as large as other programming groups, but it  is definitely progress in the right direction. We mostly talked about HTML/CSS during this semester for building websites.

I'm very excited to see how the club with grow and evolve in the next semester.

### Ballroom Dancing.

As surprising as it sounds, one of the main motivations for going to Mizzou was the fact that they had a Ballroom Dancing Club. At least, that's what I‌ thought when I enrolled in the college.

I‌ sent an email to the club... And no one responded.

Until! I got an email in October from the new ballroom club president! (She's important later on in the story)

So from late October, I‌ became a member of the Ballroom Dance Club and danced two days every week.

It was a blast and I‌ look forward to leading it next semester.

**Wait what!**

Yeah. So funny story. The current President basically has to revive the club from its ashes this year since it fell apart due to prior circumstances.

Since the vice-president graduated this semester, I‌ was chosen to become the new vice-president! The catch is that the president is out of town until March of next semester.

So yeah. I'm leading the club until then for the most part, but I'll probably ask for her help/advice probably on a weekly basis.

P.S I'm dating the president.

Yea.

What??

### Friendships and Romantic stuffs

With a new environment, comes new friends and new experiences.

This included making friends that you may not have met in High School and learning what you value when it comes to friends and beyond. Usually friends are made either from shared club stuff, classes, or shared living spaces (i.e student housing).

The friend group I‌ eventually became a part of was okay. I‌ realized late into the semester that I‌ don't vibe with them as much as I‌ did during the beginning in terms of group hangout seshes. On a individual level, I‌ think its pretty good though.

The friendships that I‌ had at the beginning of the semester were different than the ones I‌ ended up at the end. And that is alright.

Included in new experiences... Romance stuff. So there's that.

I‌ buckled and gave my hand at Tinder and Bumble. I‌ realized probably after half of the semester, it wasn't my cup of tea. I did end up dating one girl from it, but that relationship didn't last too long.

Remember the Ballroom President? Well, were both good at dancing. We both have a lot in common... We started ballroom dancing outside of club.

Then we started dating.

That pretty much sums it up without getting into the nitty gritty of it. I might go into more detail at some point, but I‌ think that suffices.

# Conclusion

I've been wanting to get back into blogging for a while now. Hence, the more chaotic and disorganized writing. I was originally going to release something a lot more structured, but you got to rip off the band-aid off at some point. Right?

That is all for now. More writing is soon to come.
