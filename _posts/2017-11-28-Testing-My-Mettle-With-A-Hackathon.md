Hey, Journal. Been a while. You know, there is this really cool type of event called Hackathons. They are basically programming competitions where programmers compete to solve a particular issue/problem.

The past few weeks of school have been interesting. Since I joined Spark, I gained many new friends . Our teacher, Michael Palmer, suggested that if we were interested we should go to a programming competition in October. These programming competitions are also known as hackathons. This is due to the extremely short time period given to build.So that's what I and other Spark students set out to do. However, it just so happened that the hackathon took place during the same weekend of homecoming.

It felt as if there was a boulder weighing on my shoulders as I waited in anticipation for the weekend. A day before the event started, something pretty heart-breaking occurred. I had to break up with my girlfriend at the time. It was as if my entire world imploded and reformed within a single day. My heart felt as if it were torn and empty. With these feeling of emptiness, I decided I would not attend homecoming, but rather focus all my energy and efforts on the competition. I would fill my heart back with something I truly love: building inventions and competing with others.

I had gone to previous hackathons/programming competitions before. When I previously competed, I really did not know my team members very well. It also always seemed that we were ill-prepared in some way or another. It was my goal in this competition to give it all I had in order to reach the top.

The first day of competition eventually did come. It was a Friday. I attended school like normal. I finally arrived to my last class, Spark. There my teacher gave us a pep talk. The information he provided was very integral part of our ability to place 3rd at the hackathon. I was also able to discuss some strategy with some of my teammates. My teacher gave us one key piece of advice. He told us, “Make the app unique/different than all the other ones”. By doing this, we would have a competitive edge against all other teams at the competition.

When I finally arrived at the competition venue, I was awestruck. There sat a tall building with the purina logo. I entered the building. I was attacked with a plethora of sights and information. To the left, the presentation stage, covered in a fabric as black as an unpowered computer screen. To the right, a collection of chairs shaped in a grid which each seated a competitor. I knew at that moment. This was no joke. There was an assortment of stickered laptops and programmers with the chaos of an auction house. I could hear the buzz of 50 laptops running simultaneously. I saw my teammates sitting on the couch already on my laptops. I smiled and walked towards them.

It took us about 2 hours to finally settle on a solution to build. We called the project and team, “Doggos for World Peace”. The goal of the project was to help connect pet owners with people who would be able to take care of their pet while they were away.

By the time we were finished for the first night. It was about 10:00 PM. We were as tired as dogs. All in all, the first day of competition was not that stressful. Usually, the second day of competition is the hardest. I hope to gain valuable skills and experience during this hackathon. That’s all I have to write about the competition in this journal entry. Stay tuned for more!
