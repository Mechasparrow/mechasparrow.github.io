Awake, Learn, Work, Sleep,<br>
The days I live...on a endless loop<br>
Awake, Learn, Compete,<br>
Chaotic days I live.

Different for three days,<br>
Three days, we compete,<br>
Computers as our weapons,<br>
Assemble, Prepare, Code

Day One, We Think,<br>
Day Two, We Code,<br>
Day Three, We Present,<br>
Day End, We Win

Problem given, Ideas created,<br>
Red Bull consumed, code produced<br>
App built, Sleep sacrificed<br>
App presented, Experience gained, Eyes Opened.
