Dear Ordinary Person,

Hello Ordinary. It is a pleasure to meet you. When I sent you a letter regarding a recent hackathon I attended, you asked that I continue talking about the competition. In this letter that I have addressed to you, I will do just that. Where do I begin? Well in the previous letter I sent, I left off on the first day of competition, so let’s start on the second.

After getting a reasonable amount of sleep, I left the comfort my home, to the competition venue once more. The great thing about the competition is that it was hosted at the Purina Headquarters in St. Louis. There were several pets walking around the building since it is a pet-friendly office.

Our team assembled at the spot we worked during the previous night. We already had all the tasks delegated from last night, so we were able to jump straight into work. I was on the side of the project that pet owners would interact when they used our app. One of our team members also brought donuts. This was a definite plus! I began the endless coding and design of the app

At first, It was just a black screen with a blinking cursor. No information, no buttons, no colors. Nothing. I then typed in a language that only the machine understood into a text editor. The page changed. I typed more arcane commands in. It changed once more. Through the individual taps of my fingers upon the keyboard. The application was slowly coming to life. There were times when there was so much happening on the screen, it looked as if I was staring at an endless expanse of stars. There were also times when what I built did not function as expected. I would have to furiously type away at the keyboard, hoping that I would eventually solve the flaw. In this competition, every keystroke and second counted.

While I was in this mad coding frenzy, I thought back to how I was years prior. I was quite young when my father introduced me to the concept of computer programming. I believe I was at the age of about ten at the time. My father gave me my first laptop that Christmas. The moment I turned it on, I was mesmerized. Later that year, he gave me a book on programming. Sometimes I would read that book from dusk to dawn. At that age, I would never have imagined that I would be participating in a competition like this six years later.

I was so obsessed with computers at the time that It seemed that I was better at interacting with them than other fellow students and people. Since that was the case, I was made fun of and called names in middle school. I often wanted to quit coding because of this. I did eventually find classmates that had the same passion that I had. This propelled me further and made me want to work harder than ever.

The year before this competition, I attended a larger one called GlobalHack. It took place in the Chaifetz arena in downtown St. Louis. I worked very hard with the team to build a useful project, however, we were only able to make it to semifinals. However, this prompted me to develop my skills further for the future. All these previous experiences were running through my mind as I continued to code during this competition.

As the day progressed, there were times of frustration and just plain euphoria. As it grew late, most of the team members left to rest for the next day. On the other hand, I still had code that I still needed to write. It was 10:00 pm at that time. I went home and continued coding until around 1:00 pm. When the last line was written. I collapsed on my bed, unsure of whether the app would work the following morning (It did).

“I never had to code so much in one day”, I thought to myself. Because of that day, I felt like I gained a better understanding of my limits and strengths with technology.

The was the most chaotic part of the competition in a nutshell Ordinary :P

Sincerely, <br>
Michael Navazhylau
